# Instagram Schema

Figure out what entities you'll need, and what relationships they should have.  Some possible entities: User, Post, Comment, Like, Follow

Visualize the schema [Quick Database Diagrams](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/).

Implement the schema following the model of [cars database](https://github.com/echoplatoonew/cars_database).  The `schema.sql` file should contain your table definitions, and `data.sql` will contain some dummy data (2 or three rows per table is fine).

When you have your postgres container running with your database, write a few queries against it to make sure everything is working.
